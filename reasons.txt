I initially attempted to use PostreSQL, because I already had it and toolkits for it installed on my home machine. I attempted to use both PGAdmin 4 and Valentina, but found the learning curve on both too steep. After that, I chose MySQL and MySQL Workbench for the fact that I had already used it, and for convenience of the forward engineering from the diagram. While this didn't work out as well as I had hoped, the job got done.
